# gaphack-refine Convergence Analysis

**STATUS: IMPLEMENTED** (2025-10-09)
- Per-sequence reclustering tracking implemented
- Priority-based seed ordering (deterministic, no randomization)
- Diagnostic logging for reclustering statistics
- Ready for experimental validation

## Problem Statement

Running gaphack-refine on Russulales dataset (8,900 sequences, ~1,100 expected clusters):
- **Initial clustering**: vsearch --cluster_fast (fast, no conflicts, creates oversplit clusters)
- **Parameters**: `--min-split 0.005`, `--max-lump 0.012-0.02`, `--refine-close-clusters 0.02-0.03`
- **Current output**: ~1,500 clusters
- **50 iterations**: ~12 hours, AMI 0.996, but **convergence not achieved**

## Previous Seed Selection Strategy (Replaced)

**Note**: This section describes the old randomized approach that has been replaced by per-sequence tracking.

**Location**: `cluster_refinement.py:pass2_iterative_merge()` (lines 634-920)

### Old Algorithm (Per Iteration):

1. **Build proximity graph** for all clusters (K-NN with BLAST)
2. **Generate seed list**: All cluster IDs in sorted order
3. **Randomize seed order**: Shuffle with seeded RNG
4. **Process each seed**:
   - Skip if already processed this iteration (as part of another scope)
   - Skip if scope already converged (sequence set signature)
   - Build refinement scope (seed + neighbors within distance thresholds)
   - Apply full gapHACk to scope
   - Store operation for batch execution
5. **Execute all operations**: Apply refinements, track changes
6. **Check convergence**: AMI = 1.0 between iterations → stop

### Key Code Snippets:

```python
# Line 739-744: Current seed selection
seed_list = sorted(current_clusters.keys())
# Shuffle seed order with seeded RNG
rng.shuffle(seed_list)

# Line 771-775: Skip converged scopes
scope_signature = frozenset(scope_headers)
if scope_signature in converged_scopes:
    logger.info(f"Skipping seed {seed_id} - prior convergence detected")
    continue

# Line 849-863: Iteration-level convergence check
iteration_ami = compute_ami_for_refinement(
    set(current_clusters.keys()),
    next_clusters,
    current_clusters
)
if iteration_ami == 1.0:
    logger.info(f"Convergence achieved at iteration {global_iteration}")
    break
```

## Convergence Issues

### 1. **Uneven Processing Across Clusters**

**Current behavior**:
- Randomized seed order means some clusters processed more than others
- Large clusters in dense regions may be selected as seeds frequently
- Small peripheral clusters may be selected less often
- No tracking of how many times each sequence has been reclustered

**Consequence**: Slow convergence as same regions refined repeatedly while others underprocessed

### 2. **AMI Convergence Sensitivity**

**Current threshold**: AMI = 1.0 (perfect agreement)

**Issues**:
- AMI 0.996 indicates 99.6% agreement but not converged
- Remaining 0.4% disagreement could be:
  - Few stubborn cluster boundaries oscillating
  - Small clusters in transition zones
  - Numerical instability in gap calculation

**Question**: Is AMI = 1.0 too strict? Should we use AMI > 0.999 or 0.998?

### 3. **Scope Convergence vs. Global Convergence**

**Current tracking**:
- `converged_scopes` tracks sequence sets that refined to themselves
- Individual scopes can converge while global clustering continues changing

**Issue**: Scope convergence doesn't guarantee global convergence if cluster boundaries shift

### 4. **Random Seed Order Creates Unpredictability**

**Current**: Shuffle seed list each iteration with seeded RNG

**Problem**:
- Arbitrary order doesn't optimize for coverage or convergence speed
- Lucky orderings process evenly, unlucky orderings concentrate on same regions
- No systematic strategy to ensure all clusters get equal attention

## Proposed Solution: Per-Sequence Reclustering Counts

**Core idea**: Track how many times each sequence has been reclustered, prioritize seeds by cluster with fewest reclusterings

### Implementation Approach:

```python
# Initialize reclustering counter (once at start of Pass 2)
sequence_recluster_count = defaultdict(int)  # seq_id -> count

# Per iteration, calculate priority for each cluster
cluster_priorities = {}
for cluster_id, cluster_headers in current_clusters.items():
    # Find minimum reclustering count in this cluster
    min_count = min(sequence_recluster_count[h] for h in cluster_headers)
    cluster_priorities[cluster_id] = min_count

# Sort seeds by priority (lowest count first)
seed_list = sorted(
    current_clusters.keys(),
    key=lambda cid: cluster_priorities[cid]
)

# After processing each scope, increment counts
for header in scope_headers:
    sequence_recluster_count[header] += 1
```

### Expected Benefits:

1. **Even processing**: Clusters with underprocessed sequences selected first
2. **Systematic coverage**: Every cluster gets attention proportional to need
3. **Faster convergence**: Reduces wasted work on already-stable regions
4. **Reproducible**: Deterministic ordering (no randomization needed)
5. **Cross-iteration consistency**: Sequence-level tracking persists across iterations

### Potential Issues:

1. **Initial state**: All sequences start at count=0 → need tiebreaker
   - **Solution**: Use cluster size or medoid distance as secondary sort key

2. **Large scope effects**: Processing seed X also processes its neighbors
   - Neighbors get incremented even if not selected as seeds
   - **This is good**: Ensures counts reflect actual refinement work

3. **Converged scope handling**: Should we stop incrementing converged sequences?
   - **Probably not**: Convergence can break if nearby clusters change

4. **Computational cost**: O(N) to find min count per cluster
   - **Negligible**: N = cluster size (typically 1-100), done once per iteration

## Implemented Solution

**Implementation complete**: 2025-10-09

The per-sequence tracking approach has been fully implemented in `cluster_refinement.py::pass2_iterative_merge()`.

### Critical Design Principle: Complete Neighborhood Consistency

**Problem**: If we process seeds with stale or partial neighborhoods, we risk oscillation without convergence based on arbitrary seed ordering.

**Example of oscillation**:
- Iteration 1, Seed A processed first: scope = {A, B, C} → merges to X
- Iteration 1, Seed D processed later: scope = {D, E, B*} → but B is stale (already consumed by seed A)
  - If we process with partial scope {D, E}, we get different result than with complete scope {D, E, B}
  - Iteration 2 will see different neighborhood structure, may undo the merge
  - Results depend on which seed happens to be processed first in each iteration

**Solution**: Skip any seed whose complete neighborhood (within `close_threshold`) contains clusters that have been processed this iteration. This ensures:
- Every GapOptimizedClustering invocation sees a consistent, complete neighborhood
- Results are deterministic based on current clustering state, not seed ordering
- Skipped seeds are reconsidered in next iteration with fresh proximity graph
- Convergence is guaranteed when all scopes are stable (no changes regardless of order)

**Implementation** (lines 786-793):
```python
# Check if ANY cluster in the scope has been processed this iteration
# If so, skip because the proximity graph is stale for this neighborhood
scope_has_processed_clusters = any(cid in processed_this_iteration for cid in scope_cluster_ids)
if scope_has_processed_clusters:
    iteration_stats['seeds_skipped_dependency'] += 1
    logger.info(f"Skipping seed {seed_id} - neighborhood changed (scope contains processed clusters)")
    continue
```

This means fewer operations per iteration (only non-overlapping scopes), but each operation uses correct, complete neighborhoods. The trade-off favors correctness and convergence over per-iteration throughput.

### Key Changes:

1. **Removed randomization** (lines 681-700):
   - Eliminated `numpy.random.default_rng()` and `rng.shuffle()`
   - Added initialization log: "Seed prioritization: per-sequence reclustering counts (deterministic)"

2. **Per-sequence tracking** (line ~698):
   ```python
   sequence_recluster_count = defaultdict(int)
   ```

3. **Priority-based seed ordering** (lines 731-756):
   ```python
   # Calculate cluster priorities based on minimum per-sequence reclustering count
   cluster_priorities = {}
   for cluster_id, cluster_headers in current_clusters.items():
       if cluster_headers:
           min_count = min(sequence_recluster_count[h] for h in cluster_headers)
           cluster_priorities[cluster_id] = min_count
       else:
           cluster_priorities[cluster_id] = 0

   # Sort seeds by priority (lowest count first), size as tiebreaker
   seed_list = sorted(
       current_clusters.keys(),
       key=lambda cid: (
           cluster_priorities[cid],
           -len(current_clusters[cid])  # Larger clusters first for ties
       )
   )
   ```

4. **Count incrementing** (lines 842-856):
   ```python
   # Update reclustering counts for all sequences in scope
   for header in scope_headers:
       sequence_recluster_count[header] += 1
   ```

5. **Comprehensive iteration tracking** (lines 725-733, 889-906):
   - Tracks: seeds_processed, seeds_skipped_dependency, seeds_skipped_convergence, seeds_skipped_other
   - Validates all seeds accounted for (skipped_other should always be 0)
   - Logs detailed summary at end of each iteration

6. **Reclustering statistics logging** (lines 852-859):
   ```python
   counts = list(sequence_recluster_count.values())
   min_count = min(counts)
   max_count = max(counts)
   mean_count = sum(counts) / len(counts)
   logger.info(f"Pass 2 Iter {global_iteration} Reclustering stats: "
              f"min={min_count}, max={max_count}, mean={mean_count:.1f}")
   ```

### Verification:

The implementation includes validation logic to ensure correctness:
- All seeds are accounted for each iteration (processed + skipped_dependency + skipped_convergence = total)
- `skipped_other` should always be 0 (if not, logs WARNING)
- Reclustering counts are monotonically increasing across iterations
- Priority distribution logged for diagnostics

### Testing:

Ready for experimental validation on:
- Russulales dataset (8,900 sequences)
- Comparison metrics: iterations to convergence, final AMI, wall-clock time
- Expected result: 10-15 iterations instead of 50+

## Alternative Approaches

### Alternative 1: Cluster-Level Reclustering Counts
Track count per cluster (not per sequence):
```python
cluster_recluster_count = defaultdict(int)  # cluster_id -> count
# Sort by cluster count directly
seed_list = sorted(
    current_clusters.keys(),
    key=lambda cid: cluster_recluster_count[cid]
)
```

**Pros**: Simpler, faster
**Cons**: Loses cross-iteration consistency when cluster IDs change

### Alternative 2: Priority Queue by Cluster Age
Track when each cluster was last refined:
```python
cluster_last_refined = {}  # cluster_id -> iteration_number
# Sort by staleness (oldest first)
seed_list = sorted(
    current_clusters.keys(),
    key=lambda cid: cluster_last_refined.get(cid, 0)
)
```

**Pros**: Focuses on stale clusters
**Cons**: Doesn't account for merge/split creating new clusters

### Alternative 3: Medoid Distance-Based Priority
Prioritize clusters with high internal distance variance:
```python
# Calculate p95 intra-cluster distance for each cluster
cluster_cohesion = {}
for cluster_id, headers in current_clusters.items():
    distances = get_intra_distances(headers)
    cluster_cohesion[cluster_id] = np.percentile(distances, 95)

# Sort by cohesion (highest p95 first) = least cohesive clusters
seed_list = sorted(
    current_clusters.keys(),
    key=lambda cid: cluster_cohesion[cid],
    reverse=True
)
```

**Pros**: Targets problematic clusters directly
**Cons**: Expensive to calculate, may over-refine boundary clusters

### Alternative 4: Adaptive AMI Threshold
Rather than changing seed order, relax convergence criterion:
```python
# Use adaptive threshold based on dataset size
ami_threshold = max(0.999, 1.0 - (len(clusters) / 100000))
if iteration_ami >= ami_threshold:
    logger.info(f"Convergence achieved (AMI={iteration_ami:.4f})")
    break
```

**Pros**: Simple, may solve slow convergence issue
**Cons**: Doesn't address uneven processing, just stops earlier

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Implement Per-Sequence Tracking (Recommended)

**Changes to `pass2_iterative_merge()`**:

1. Initialize counter before iteration loop (line 704):
```python
sequence_recluster_count = defaultdict(int)
```

2. Calculate priorities and sort (replace lines 739-744):
```python
# Calculate cluster priorities based on min sequence reclustering count
cluster_priorities = {}
for cluster_id, cluster_headers in current_clusters.items():
    if cluster_headers:
        min_count = min(sequence_recluster_count[h] for h in cluster_headers)
        cluster_priorities[cluster_id] = min_count
    else:
        cluster_priorities[cluster_id] = 0

# Sort seeds by priority (lowest count first), with cluster size as tiebreaker
seed_list = sorted(
    current_clusters.keys(),
    key=lambda cid: (
        cluster_priorities[cid],
        -len(current_clusters[cid])  # Larger clusters first for ties
    )
)
```

3. Increment counts after processing (after line 783):
```python
# Update reclustering counts for all sequences in scope
for header in scope_headers:
    sequence_recluster_count[header] += 1
```

4. Add logging (line 713):
```python
# Log priority distribution
priority_counts = defaultdict(int)
for priority in cluster_priorities.values():
    priority_counts[priority] += 1
logger.info(f"Priority distribution: {dict(priority_counts)}")
```

### Phase 2: Add Diagnostic Tracking

Track and log per-iteration:
- Min/max/mean reclustering counts
- Clusters by priority bucket (0, 1-5, 6-10, 10+)
- Scope convergence rate vs. global AMI

### Phase 3: Evaluate Effectiveness

**Metrics to compare**:
1. **Iterations to convergence** (primary goal)
2. **Final AMI score** (should be comparable or better)
3. **Final clustering quality** (ARI, homogeneity vs. ground truth)
4. **Wall-clock time** (should improve with fewer iterations)

**Test datasets**:
- Russulales (8,900 sequences)
- Russula subset (1,429 sequences)
- Smaller test sets (50, 100, 200, 300, 500)

### Phase 4: Optional Enhancements

If Phase 1 improves but doesn't solve:
- Combine with adaptive AMI threshold (Alt 4)
- Add medoid distance as tertiary sort key (Alt 3)
- Implement early stopping for individual scopes

## Example Logging Output

The implemented solution produces comprehensive diagnostic logging per iteration:

```

```

**Key observations from logging**:
- **Iteration 1**: All sequences start at count=0, equal priority
  - Only ~400 seeds processed (non-overlapping neighborhoods)
  - ~1,100 skipped due to neighborhood changes (overlapping neighborhoods)
  - Reclustering stats: max=1 (each sequence counted once)
- **Iteration 2**: Reclustering counts now range 1-5, prioritization active
  - Seeds with underprocessed sequences prioritized
  - More seeds can process (neighborhoods changed from iteration 1)
- **Iteration 12**: Most scopes converged (1,000 skipped), only 100 seeds need processing
- **Convergence**: Achieved when AMI=1.000 (all scopes stable)
- **Validation**: `skipped (other/ERROR)` always 0, confirming all seeds accounted for
- **No "inputs already consumed" messages**: All operations use consistent neighborhoods

**Expected improvements**:
- Convergence in ~10-15 iterations instead of 50+
- Faster iterations as more scopes converge (less work per iteration)
- Deterministic, reproducible behavior (no random seed dependence)
- Clear visibility into convergence progress

## Open Questions

1. **What is the convergence bottleneck?**
   - Are specific clusters oscillating?
   - Are boundary sequences moving between stable clusters?
   - Is AMI = 1.0 threshold too strict?

2. **Does randomization help or hurt?**
   - Remove randomization and compare deterministic vs. random
   - Measure variance across multiple random seeds

3. **How much does scope overlap matter?**
   - High overlap → same sequences refined repeatedly
   - Low overlap → independent scopes, better parallelism potential

4. **Should we stop processing converged scopes?**
   - Current: Skip if scope signature in `converged_scopes`
   - Proposal: More aggressive skipping to reduce wasted work

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Phase 1** (per-sequence tracking)
2. **Run comparison experiment**:
   - Current (random seed order) vs. Proposed (priority-based)
   - Same dataset, same parameters, measure iterations/AMI/time
3. **Analyze convergence patterns**:
   - Which clusters converge quickly vs. slowly?
   - Do priority-based seeds reduce oscillation?
4. **Iterate based on results**
