# Phase 3 Follow-up Issues

## Status: ALL RESOLVED ✅

All three issues identified after Phase 3 have been investigated and fixed.

## Fixed Issues

### Issue 1: Post-processing runs after interruption ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: When user presses Ctrl+C during initial clustering, the code breaks out of the loop but then continues to run conflict resolution and close cluster refinement stages before exiting.

**Expected behavior**: Save checkpoint and exit immediately without running refinement stages.

**Fix location**: `decompose.py` around line 831-835

**Code change implemented**:
```python
# Check for interruption before post-processing
if interruption_requested['flag']:
    self.logger.info("Skipping post-processing stages due to interruption")
    # Return results immediately without refinement
    return results

# Perform initial conflict verification after decomposition
initial_verification = self._verify_no_conflicts(...)
```

**Testing**: Added `test_interrupt_skips_refinement()` in `test_interruption_edge_cases.py`

---

### Issue 2: No detection of partial state on fresh run ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Running `gaphack-decompose input.fasta -o output/` twice overwrites existing state without warning, even if previous run was interrupted.

**Expected behavior**:
- Detect if `output/state.json` exists
- If state shows `status="in_progress"`, error with message directing user to --resume
- If state shows `status="completed"`, error with message to use different output directory

**Fix location**: `decompose_cli.py` around line 481-502

**Code change implemented**:
```python
# Check for existing state if not resuming
if not args.resume:
    state_file = output_dir / "state.json"
    if state_file.exists():
        # Load existing state to check status
        from gaphack.state import DecomposeState
        try:
            existing_state = DecomposeState.load(output_dir)
            if existing_state.status == "in_progress":
                logger.error(f"Output directory contains partial state from interrupted run")
                logger.error(f"Use --resume to continue from checkpoint:")
                logger.error(f"  {sys.argv[0]} --resume {output_dir}")
                sys.exit(1)
            elif existing_state.status == "completed":
                logger.error(f"Output directory contains completed run")
                logger.error(f"Use a different output directory or delete {output_dir}")
                sys.exit(1)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Could not load existing state: {e}")
            logger.error(f"Output directory {output_dir} contains state.json but cannot be loaded")
            logger.error(f"Delete {output_dir} or use different output path")
            sys.exit(1)
```

**Testing**: Added `test_detect_partial_state_on_restart()` in `test_interruption_edge_cases.py`

---

### Issue 3: Multiprocessing signal handling ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: The signal handler is only installed in the main process. During conflict resolution and close cluster refinement, core gapHACk uses multiprocessing workers which may not handle SIGINT properly.

**Investigation findings**:
1. Core gapHACk uses `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` (not `multiprocessing.Pool`)
2. Executor is created in `core.py:642` with proper initialization
3. Executor is shut down in `finally` block at `core.py:694` with `executor.shutdown(wait=True)`
4. When SIGINT occurs:
   - Signal is delivered to all processes in the process group (parent + workers)
   - Workers will receive SIGINT and terminate
   - Parent's signal handler sets `interruption_requested['flag'] = True`
   - Finally block ensures executor cleanup regardless of how method exits
   - Current implementation handles this correctly

**Conclusion**: No code changes needed. The existing `finally` block pattern ensures proper cleanup.

**OS behavior (Unix/POSIX)**:
- Ctrl+C sends SIGINT to foreground process group (all processes) ✅
- Python's `ProcessPoolExecutor` workers will receive signal and terminate ✅
- Parent's finally block cleans up executor ✅

**Testing**:
1. Interrupt during initial clustering (single-threaded BLAST) - WORKS ✅
2. Conflict resolution with multiprocessing - cleanup verified ✅
3. Close cluster refinement with multiprocessing - cleanup verified ✅
4. Test added: `test_multiprocessing_cleanup_on_interrupt()` ✅

## Implementation Summary

All three issues have been fixed in Phase 3.5:

### Tests Created
`tests/test_interruption_edge_cases.py` with 3 tests:
1. `test_detect_partial_state_on_restart()` - Verifies CLI detects existing state and requires --resume
2. `test_interrupt_skips_refinement()` - Verifies interruption skips post-processing stages
3. `test_multiprocessing_cleanup_on_interrupt()` - Documents investigation findings and verifies cleanup

### Files Modified
- `gaphack/decompose.py` - Added interruption check before post-processing (line 831-835)
- `gaphack/decompose_cli.py` - Added state detection before starting new run (line 481-502)
- `docs/PHASE3_ISSUES.md` - Updated with implementation details and resolutions

### Test Results
All 3 Phase 3.5 tests passing ✅
- `test_detect_partial_state_on_restart` - PASSED
- `test_interrupt_skips_refinement` - PASSED
- `test_multiprocessing_cleanup_on_interrupt` - PASSED

## Actual Effort

- Issue 1: 20 minutes (straightforward flag check)
- Issue 2: 45 minutes (state detection and error messages)
- Issue 3: 30 minutes (investigation confirmed existing implementation correct)

**Total**: ~1.5 hours for Phase 3.5 cleanup
