# Phase 4 Complete: Staged Refinement

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 4 work is done, including implementation and testing of staged refinement capability.

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 4: Staged Refinement
Implemented capability to apply refinement stages to resumed clustering runs.

**Key Features**:
1. Apply conflict resolution after initial clustering completes
2. Apply close cluster refinement after initial clustering completes
3. Chain refinement stages (conflict resolution → close cluster refinement)
4. Track refinement history in state
5. Smart handling when no refinement is needed (no conflicts, already optimal)

**Implementation Details**:

#### Helper Functions Added (`decompose.py`)

1. **`_apply_conflict_resolution_stage()`** (lines 1636-1742)
   - Applies conflict resolution to loaded clusters from FASTA files
   - Handles case where no conflicts exist (marks stage complete without creating new files)
   - Creates deconflicted.cluster_*.fasta files when conflicts are resolved
   - Updates state with conflict statistics and completion status

2. **`_apply_close_cluster_refinement_stage()`** (lines 1745-1860)
   - Applies close cluster refinement to loaded clusters
   - Creates ClusterGraph for proximity queries
   - Creates refined.cluster_*.fasta files
   - Tracks refinement history with timestamps and thresholds
   - Supports chaining multiple refinement passes

#### State Manager Enhancement (`state.py`)

1. **`StateManager.save_stage_results()`** (lines 539-623)
   - Saves DecomposeResults to FASTA files with stage prefixes
   - Handles hash ID expansion for duplicate sequences
   - Creates both cluster files and unassigned files
   - Properly formats FASTA with 2-line format

#### Resume Logic Updated (`decompose.py`)

1. **`resume_decompose()`** modified (lines 1476-1497)
   - Now calls `_apply_conflict_resolution_stage()` when `resolve_conflicts=True`
   - Calls `_apply_close_cluster_refinement_stage()` when `refine_close_clusters > 0`
   - Removed NotImplementedError placeholders

#### Smart Pattern Management

- When conflict resolution finds no conflicts:
  - Stage marked complete
  - Pattern remains as initial clustering pattern
  - No new files created
  - Statistics updated correctly

- When conflict resolution resolves conflicts:
  - New deconflicted files created
  - Pattern updated to "deconflicted.cluster_*.fasta"
  - Stage marked complete

## Test Summary

**Total: 3 tests passing** (`tests/test_phase4_refinement.py`)
- `test_apply_conflict_resolution_after_initial_clustering` - PASSED
- `test_apply_close_cluster_refinement_after_initial_clustering` - PASSED
- `test_chained_refinement_stages` - PASSED

All tests use realistic biological sequences and verify:
- State transitions and completion flags
- FASTA file creation (when applicable)
- Stage chaining correctness
- Statistics tracking

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `gaphack/decompose.py`:
  - Added `_apply_conflict_resolution_stage()` function
  - Added `_apply_close_cluster_refinement_stage()` function
  - Updated `resume_decompose()` to call refinement stages
  - Fixed datetime usage (`datetime.datetime.now()`)
  - Fixed LazyDistanceProvider initialization parameters

- `gaphack/state.py`:
  - Added `StateManager.save_stage_results()` method for saving staged results

### Tests
- `tests/test_phase4_refinement.py` (new file, 262 lines)
  - Test conflict resolution after initial clustering
  - Test close cluster refinement after initial clustering
  - Test chained refinement stages (conflict → refinement)

### Documentation
- `docs/PHASE4_COMPLETE.md` (this file)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. No-Op Refinement Handling
When a refinement stage has nothing to do (no conflicts, clusters already optimal):
- Mark stage as complete
- Don't create new FASTA files
- Keep existing file pattern
- Update statistics to reflect no-op

This avoids unnecessary file proliferation and keeps the output directory clean.

### 2. Distance Provider Initialization
Refinement stages don't have access to original alignment parameters, so they use defaults:
```python
LazyDistanceProvider(
    sequences=sequences,
    alignment_method="adjusted",
    end_skip_distance=20,
    normalize_homopolymers=True,
    handle_iupac_overlap=True,
    normalize_indels=True,
    max_repeat_motif_length=2
)
```

This ensures consistent behavior across resume operations.

### 3. Refinement History Tracking
Close cluster refinement can be chained multiple times with different thresholds.
The history tracks:
- Threshold used
- Timestamp
- Clusters before/after
- Allows analysis of refinement progression

### 4. FASTA as Source of Truth
Consistent with Phase 1-3 design:
- State JSON contains metadata only
- Cluster membership reconstructed from FASTA files
- Allows manual editing between stages
- No hidden state inconsistencies

## Integration with Existing Phases

**Phase 1** (State Management): Extended with refinement stage tracking
**Phase 2** (Initial Clustering Continuation): Works seamlessly with refinement
**Phase 3** (Graceful Interruption): Refinement stages respect interruption signals
**Phase 4** (Staged Refinement): NEW - Completes the incremental workflow

## Usage Examples

### Apply Conflict Resolution After Initial Clustering
```python
from gaphack.decompose import DecomposeClustering, resume_decompose

# Initial clustering
decomposer = DecomposeClustering(min_split=0.005, max_lump=0.02, resolve_conflicts=False)
decomposer.decompose('input.fasta', output_dir='results/')

# Later: Apply conflict resolution
resume_decompose(output_dir='results/', resolve_conflicts=True)
```

### Apply Close Cluster Refinement
```python
# After initial clustering
resume_decompose(output_dir='results/', refine_close_clusters=0.02)
```

### Chain Refinement Stages
```python
# Initial clustering
decomposer.decompose('input.fasta', output_dir='results/')

# Apply conflict resolution
resume_decompose(output_dir='results/', resolve_conflicts=True)

# Then refine close clusters
resume_decompose(output_dir='results/', refine_close_clusters=0.02)
```

## Known Limitations

**Addressed in This Phase**:
- ✅ Cannot apply refinement after initial clustering completes
- ✅ Cannot chain refinement stages
- ✅ No refinement history tracking

**Remaining Limitations** (Future Work):
1. **Phase 5 not implemented**: No finalization stage
   - Cannot create final numbered output (cluster_001.fasta, cluster_002.fasta, etc.)
   - Cannot mark run as "completed"
   - Cannot cleanup intermediate stage files

2. **No incremental sequence addition**: Cannot add new sequences to existing clusters

3. **Refinement parameter changes**: Cannot change min_split/max_lump during refinement stages

## Next Phase

**Phase 5: Finalization**

Tasks remaining:
- Implement `--finalize` command
- Create final numbered cluster output
- Mark state as "completed"
- Optional cleanup of intermediate stage files
- Add command to CLI

See `docs/INCREMENTAL_DESIGN.md` for detailed design.

Phase 4 is complete and ready for Phase 5 (if needed)!
